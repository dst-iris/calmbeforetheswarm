          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p><strong>Swarms are on the cusp of being a practical reality. They offer a new way of delivering
              functionality, with many parts coming together to form a whole. But challenges remain: designing swarm
              behaviours – which are not a property of the component sub-units but only emerge from the entire swarm
              system – is a difficult task. For now, readers would be right to be sceptical of bold claims: what is
              possible in a lab far outstrips swarms' maturity in uncontrolled environments.
              And even if/when swarms do become realistically useable in operational environments, the cost and
              complexity of procuring and operating them may take away from their benefits.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Nevertheless, swarming technology does offer some compelling advantages – speed, volume, resilience
              – and it is an area of active and growing research interest both in the UK and for our partners and
              competitors. Commercial developments in other fields mean that the components needed for swarms are likely
              to be available at suitably low prices, and assembling them into at least a basic swarm will not be a
              great technical challenge. Guaranteeing that the swarm works as intended (that point about designing
              behaviours) might take a little longer, and it's for this reason that UK Defence may need to defend
              against swarms before it is possible to field one.
            </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Military-specific swarm research and development is ongoing: perhaps the less-advanced strand of
              development is Defence thinking on command and control of swarms, and on how they might be used alongside
              other types of autonomous system and more conventional capabilities.

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p><strong>The swarm. A paradoxical idea of huge collective scale and small individual size. A staple of
              modern science fiction. And now a technological reality, promising the ability to marshal vast numbers of
              bots in service of a single goal – and the return of mass to Western militaries.</strong></p>
          <p>So it would seem, at least, if we believe the breathless popular science articles that pop up with
            reasonable regularity.<span class="reference">Hollings, Alex, 'Watch: Raytheon shows how drone swarms and

            But what’s the reality underneath the hype?
            And what, realistically, are the benefits that swarms might bring?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="what" class="contentBody">
          <h1>What is a swarm?</h1>
          <p>Before we can answer those questions, though, we need to know what we’re actually talking about – what
            <i>is</i> a swarm?
          </p>
          <p>Perhaps it's easier to start with what a swarm isn't: it isn't just a big group of things (we’ll use the
            technical term <i>nodes</i>). There's an important conceptual distinction: when we think of a group, the
            primary 'building blocks' are the members of the group – they separately provide capability that adds up to
            a total effect; when we think of a swarm, <strong>the swarm itself is the primary building block</strong>,
            with a capability that is <strong>distributed</strong> across the swarm.</p>
          <p>A swarm is a collective, built up from nodes that each have some discrete amount of functional capability.
            The nodes work together following a defined set of rules, collectively producing a whole that has qualities
            and a total level of capability that are greater than the sum of its parts, a property called
            <strong>emergence</strong>.<span class="reference">Beni, Gerardo, ‘From Swarm Intelligence to Swarm
              Robotics’, <i>Proc. of Workshop on
                Swarm Robotics, 8th Int'l Conf. on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB '04)</i>, 13-17 July 2004, <a

          </p>
          <p>The nodes that make up a swarm are <strong>interchangeable</strong>, although not necessarily completely
            identical. They may temporarily take on different roles within the swarm; they may have some degree of
            specialism; or a swarm might be made up of several distinct sub-populations – but a significant degree of
            interchangeability must exist for the group to be considered a true swarm.</p>
          <p>Swarms exist in nature as a result of many individual animals following a shared set of rules for how they
            behave. In many cases they offer the group as a whole some sort of advantage: making it more difficult to
            predators to catch them, bringing individuals together to mate, or making migration less energy-intensive.
            But although the whole group benefits, the natural swarms are not guided by any central intelligence: their
            behaviour is determined by their internal rules and their <i>boundary conditions</i> – in other words, their
            environment. In contrast, technological swarms do need some way for a user to direct or control them if
            they're to be practically useful. That control may be continuous or momentary (for example loading a set of
            instructions that are then followed autonomously), and is exerted over the swarm as a whole, not individual
            nodes: swarm nodes are <strong>autonomous</strong>. Control can be achieved in several ways:<span

            <li>the algorithms that each node uses to decide on its actions can be switched – for example switching from

            <li>the parameters or objectives those algorithms use can be changed – for example setting the maximum speed
              for a node or a target set of co-ordinates;</li>
            <li>or the swarm's environment can be controlled, forcing it to respond in the desired way – for example

          <h1>Why swarms?</h1>
          <p>Before getting any deeper into the details of swarms, there’s an important question we need to answer: why
            should anyone be interested?</p>
          <p>Many of the benefits of swarms come from the fact that they are made up of a large number of small
            nodes:<span class="reference">Hammes, Thomas X., ‘The future of warfare: small, many, smart vs. few &
              exquisite?’,
              <i>War on the Rocks</i>, 16 July 2014, <a target="_blank"
                href="https://warontherocks.com/2014/07/the-future-of-warfare-small-many-smart-vs-few-exquisite/">https://warontherocks.com/2014/07/the-future-of-warfare-small-many-smart-vs-few-exquisite/</a>
            </span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Swarms make quick work of big jobs.</strong> The many individual nodes in a swarm mean a task
              can be divided into many little chunks, with each node working on its own chunk at the same time as all
              the others are working on theirs. In many cases, that means a swarm can do a job faster than a single,
              more sophisticated entity. Say you want to take high-resolution aerial photographs of an area: a
              100-strong swarm would in principle be able to finish quicker than a single larger aircraft.</li>
          </ul>

            <img class="imgContent" src="assets/ParallelWork.gif"
              alt="An animation of a swarm covering a set area vs a single larger entity covering the same area" />
          </div>
          <div class="captionDiv">An animation showing how breaking a big task down into several smaller chunks can
            allow a swarm to do it more quickly than a single more-capable entity.
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Swarms provide volume.</strong> Swarms multiply the rate at which work can be done – every node
              can work in parallel with the others. Swarms also offer a more straightforward sort of volume: weight of
              numbers. This is particularly relevant in a defence and security context, both through the military
              concept of mass and through a slightly more technological version of the same idea, in which an attacker
              presents more targets to a defensive system than it has capacity to engage, ensuring some get through.
              Swarms could equally be used in a defensive role, using the large number of nodes to increase the
              likelihood one will succeed in stopping an incoming attacker.</li>
            <li><strong>Swarms are (sometimes) cheap.</strong> The relationship between cost and capability is
              non-linear, so it can often be less expensive to buy ten units of a basic system than to buy one unit of a
              system with ten times the capability. If you can combine those ten units into a swarm that has the same
              overall effect, then the swarm can provide the same amount of capability at lower cost. But the economics
              may not always work out.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A lot of these benefits can be realised with any large group, but the addition of a swarm's emergent
            properties, the interchangeability of its nodes, and its autonomy multiplies and extends them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Swarms are resilient.</strong> If one node stops working, it has only a small impact on the
              outcome because others can step in to replace it, self-organising to re-allocate tasks. This applies
              whether the underlying cause is some sort of failure or the result of an attack. Returning to the previous
              example, if someone wanted to stop you photographing your target area, they’d have to eliminate every
              single swarm node – compared to eliminating just one larger entity. </li>
            <li><strong>Swarms are flexible.</strong> A swarm’s size and shape are not fixed, but can be reconfigured to
              meet changing needs. This can be dynamic, the swarm adapting responsively to the context, or it can be
              task-dependent, with a single swarm carrying out a multi-phase mission and reconfiguring itself between
              phases. In a military context, this responsiveness can build on the effect of mass – the weight of numbers
              – by allowing nodes to work together to confuse or avoid defensive measures, in the same way a shoal of
              fish might work together to confuse and escape a predator.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Swarms, especially technological ones, are perhaps most readily imagined as airborne things. But in fact,
            swarms can operate in any domain: on the ground, on or under the sea, in space, or in the digital world
            (although we tend to imagine swarms as operating in physical space, the same principles can equally be
            applied to activity in the cyber domain).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="apps" class="contentBody">
          <h1>Swarm applications</h1>
          <p>The inherent benefits of swarms make them particularly well-suited to applications in
            information-gathering, transport, and – in a military context – offensive or defensive uses.</p>
          <h2>Information-gathering</h2>
          <p>A swarm’s distributed capability means it can quickly cover a large area at close range: an airborne swarm
            could collect close-up aerial imagery and other sensor data to rapidly build a multi-layered,
            high-resolution map of an area – or it could fly around and through a large structure like a bridge to
            inspect it for defects. It also means a swarm can collect measurements at the same time from different
            places, which can be useful for the development of accurate digital models or to reduce the likelihood of
            missing a moving target of interest in the area being surveyed.</p>
          <p>The interchangeability of a swarm’s nodes means that a swarm can have an effective endurance far longer
            than that of any individual node. By continuously retiring and replacing nodes for refuelling or recharging,
            a swarm can provide extended-duration surveillance – or even permanent coverage – of an area.</p>
          <p>To be effective in an information-gathering application, a swarm will need to be integrated with other
            parts of a wider system. It will need to get to and from the location of interest, it will need to be
            controlled, and the data it collects will need to be retrieved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Movement.</strong> A swarm could travel from a fixed home base to a location of interest under
              its own power, but it is more likely that it will be transported at least some of the distance in some
              other vehicle. The way in which it is transported, deployed, and recovered – if it is to be recovered at
              all – will all need consideration.</li>
            <li><strong>Control.</strong> It may be advantageous for a swarm to complete its information-gathering task
              without the need for any control link, or the user may want to have the ability to monitor it and
              intervene: either way, it’s important to start with a good understanding of the requirement for control
              over the swarm.</li>
            <li><strong>Data.</strong> The time-sensitivity of the data and the availability of a suitable
              communications link will determine whether data is sent back to a home base on the fly or if it is simply
              downloaded at the end of the task. In this latter case, it is important to consider the way data is stored
              within the swarm, both to avoid data loss should a node fail and to simplify the data download process.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The potential ability of a swarm to offer wide and persistent coverage makes swarming technology
            particularly relevant to the multi-domain Information, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance challenge set out in
            the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-science-and-technology-strategy-2020"
              target="_blank">MOD Science and Technology Strategy 2020</a>. Similarly, the resilience of swarms against
            loss of communications links – either within the swarm or with a command hub – or loss of nodes means that
            they're also particularly relevant to the
            Strategy's Freedom of Access and Manoeuvre challenge.</p>

          </div>
          <h2>Logistics</h2>
          <p>A swarm can, collectively, carry a large load, can deliver it to one place or many, and can do so all at
            once or over a longer period of time. A fire-fighting swarm could draw on water from a single source to
            tackle fires in multiple places, or could support a much more continuous flow of water to one fire than a
            single, larger firefighting platform. A seed-planting swarm can take a supply of seeds and quickly
            distribute them across a field – or a similar system could deposit remote sensor packages over a wide area
            (or equally, the nodes themselves could become the sensors).
          </p>
          <p>Swarms for transport will require similar consideration of the appropriate approach to control over them.
            The introduction of a physical interface with some wider logistic system – the point at which the thing
            being transported is transferred to the swarm – will requires some additional design effort. The large
            number of nodes in a swarm means that any friction at that interface, like a need for human operator
            intervention, will be amplified.</p>
          <h2>Offensive</h2>
          <p>The most headline-grabbing military application of swarms is in an offensive role. The combination of the
            large number of nodes and the responsiveness of swarms makes them seem a useful tool for conducting attacks
            against strong defences. This application requires a clear understanding of the way in which the swarm is to
            deliver its effect, and careful consideration of how meaningful human control of the use of lethal force

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Concepts.</strong> A swarm could be used to evade adversary defences to strike a target, relying
              on the inability of the defensive system to eliminate every node before the target is struck. It could be
              used in an attritive strategy, sacrificing nodes to force the adversary to exhaust their ability to
              continue eliminating them – or making it un-economic to do so. Or it could be used for deception,
              saturating sensors and drawing the attention of defensive systems while some other capability executes a
              strike. Each approach would imply different priorities for the design of the swarm and its nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningful human control.</strong> In common with other autonomous systems, consideration of how
              meaningful human control is exerted over the use of lethal force by swarms will be needed.</li>

          <h1>How to build a swarm</h1>
          <p>So you've got an application that sounds like a good fit for a swarm: does that mean it's time to start
            building? Well, no – first you need to double-check if a swarm is actually the right solution.
          <h2>Is a swarm right for the job?</h2>
          <p>Swarms build up an overall capability from many small chunks – but how small? Before you start building
            your swarm, you have to understand what the right size for those chunks is. In some cases, it might not be
            possible to divide up the capability to a sufficient extent to make a swarm approach make sense – or it
            might not be possible to divide it up at all. </p>
          <p>There are other reasons a swarm-based solution might not make sense, and these too need consideration.
            Large numbers of nodes mean that per-node costs can quickly mount up:
          <ul>
            <li>if the total cost turns out to be higher than for a single platform that can meet the need then a swarm
              will not be cost-effective;</li>
            <li>if the expected rate at which nodes may fail or be lost is high, the cost to replace them might make
              operating a swarm too expensive;</li>
            <li>if the cost of powering or of refuelling the nodes is too high;</li>
            <li>nodes need maintenance – the cost or effort needed for that may be too great.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Even if the cost implications of a large number of nodes do work out, the extra development effort involved
            in producing robust, controllable true swarming behaviour may mean that other ways of controlling large
            numbers of nodes are more attractive – like pre-programming them or using some form of remote control,
            resulting in a group that is not a true swarm.</p>
          <h2>Design choices</h2>
          <p>Once you’ve confirmed a swarm approach is right for your particular problem, you need to figure out a
            command and control architecture. You could pre-program your swarm to carry out a task; have every node
            connecting back to a central command and control hub; use a defined hierarchy within the swarm; use a
            dynamic mesh network; or employ some combination of all of these. <strong>The choice of swarm architecture
              will depend on the communications channels you’ll have available to you, practical considerations around
              the communications abilities of each swarm member, and on how flexible or responsive you want your swarm
              to be.</strong> The need for some form of fail-safe behaviour, the degree of autonomy desired and whether
            that's fixed or variable, and the requirement for real-time data and control links will also influence the
            choice.</p>

          </table>
          <p>The choice of command and control architecture will also depend on the level of human control needed over
            the swarm’s actions.<span class="reference">Verbruggen, Maaike, ‘The question of swarms control: challenges
              to ensuring human
              control over military swarms’, <i>Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Paper no. 65</i>, December 2019, <a
                target="_blank"

            The idea of what constitutes
            <i>meaningful</i> human control for a swarm raises a challenge: swarms are not controlled by passing
            commands directly to swarm nodes, but by setting parameters within which the swarm as a whole operates. If
            human control over some action the swarm might take is needed, you need to decide whether you want the swarm
            to seek permission for each instance of that action; pre-authorise action subject to certain criteria being
            met; or take an approach somewhere in between. This challenge is shared with other autonomous systems, but
            is particularly acute for swarms given the defining lack of direct control over individuals.
          </p>
          <h2>Energy</h2>
          <p>Another important early design consideration for your swarm is how its energy needs will be managed. Each
            node will require energy: to move, to run processors and communications equipment, and to power sensors. The
            size, weight, and cost of each node will need to be balanced against the length of time it can power itself
            for. Depending on the application, nodes may be able to return to a base and refuel or recharge mid-mission,
            or they may need to carry sufficient energy to complete it. It may also be possible to effectively share
            energy within the swarm, either by transferring energy between nodes or by dynamically assigning
            energy-intensive tasks to nodes with the most energy remaining.<span class="reference">Melhuish, C. and
              Kubo, M., 'Collective Energy Distribution: Maintaining the Energy Balance in Distributed Autonomous Robots

          </p>
          <h2>Simulation</h2>
          <p>One way to generate evidence on whether a swarm-based solution is appropriate to your problem, and if so
            what architecture might work best, is to simulate it. Simulation can also help with understanding how swarms
            can be integrated with other elements of a wider system – or how swarms operated by other people (including
            people with hostile intent) might affect existing systems. </p>
          <p>The technology to simulate swarms is actually more mature than real-life swarming technology, because many
            of the barriers to development progress for swarms are related to practicalities: things like measurement
            errors, logistics, or the large up-front cost of building an experimental swarm. Swarm simulations have seen
            significant academic and industry effort, with a range of proprietary and open-source tools now
            available.<span class="reference">Soria, E., Schiano, F., and Floreano,D., 'SwarmLab: a Matlab Drone Swarm
              Simulator',
              2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020, pp. 8005-8011,

            In general, these have been integrated into current
            military simulation tools only in a limited, experimental way: this is a due to a combination of limited
            demand and technical challenge (although individual node behaviours can be simulated easily, achieving a
            simulation of emergent behaviour that matches what happens in the real world is difficult)</p>
          <h2>Practicalities</h2>
          <p>After you’ve got your swarm architecture sorted, you can move on to the details of designing and building
            the swarm. There are still challenges here: you need to prioritise keeping the unit cost of swarm members
            down if you’re to make a swarm approach cost-effective. Fortunately, some current technology trends can help
            you out there...</p>
        </div>
        <div id="tech" class="contentBody">
          <h1>Underlying tech</h1>
          <p>Each swarm node is actually a pretty complex system in its own right. It has to fulfil several important
            functions, and do it all at minimal cost: it will need some sort of <strong>navigational sensing</strong>,
            so that it knows where it is relative to its environment and relative to the other swarm members; a
            <strong>communications</strong> package to allow it to talk to its peers and/or connect back to a command
            hub; <strong>processing</strong> capability to run the control algorithms and deal with all the data from
            the sensors; some means of <strong>motion control</strong>; a <strong>power source</strong> to keep
            everything running; and of course some sort of <strong>payload</strong> to provide the basic functionality
            you want the swarm for in the first place – perhaps a camera to take photos, a seed dispenser to sow plants,
            or an explosive warhead.
          </p>
          <h2 id="navsense">Navigational sensing</h2>
          <p>Nodes will in almost all cases need an understanding of their position and surroundings for navigation and
            collision avoidance. The
            accuracy provided by low-cost satellite positioning or inertial navigation modules isn't good enough for a
            swarm, but these can be combined with a wide range of readily-available sensors to improve accuracy: air
            pressure sensors; ultrasonic/laser distance measurement for altitude sensing; and magnetic field sensors to
            determine orientation, among others. There are many sensors of these sorts readily and cheaply available,
            developed for use in consumer devices like smartphones or retail drones. Even greater accuracy is promised
            by specialist 3D-scanning sensors being developed for applications like augmented reality devices or
            self-driving cars, and by the application of real-time processing of feeds from cameras to generate 3D
            models of the node's environment.</p>
          <p>Communication within the swarm can also aid in refining and extending each node's awareness of its
            surroundings, by sharing sensor data and using collaborative approaches to arrive at a shared understanding,
            reducing the effect of individual measurement errors.</p>
          <h2>Communications</h2>
          <p>Data-sharing within the swarm is one reason that every node needs some sort of communications capability:
            some or all nodes may also need the ability to communicate with a command hub. There are a variety of
            already-developed communications standards and systems to allow in-swarm networking, including using dynamic
            mesh approaches. These have been, and continue to be, developed for applications in consumer electronics
            such as smart home devices and industrial 'internet of things' applications, both large and growing markets
            that are likely to drive further development and cost reduction.</p>
          <p>The longer-range communications requirements for connections back to a command hub are a familiar
            requirement from
            current military unmanned air systems, and similar technologies – with a similar degree of military
            specificity – would apply to swarms. The major difference is the even greater imperative to focus on cost.
          </p>
          <p>For both intra-swarm communications and communications to a command hub, security will be an important
            concern. The many nodes in a swarm present a large overall cyber attack surface, and could afford an
            attacker a way to hijack the swarm.</p>
          <h2>Processing</h2>
          <p>Depending on the complexity of the sensor suite and the control algorithm, substantial processing ability
            may be required. And this has to be delivered with constraints on size, weight, electrical power
            consumption, and cost. The proliferation of smartphones has established a large demand for cheap, low-power,
            high-performing processors, and similar problems are faced in many edge computing systems: demand for these
            is likely to drive a continued expansion in the availability of suitable components. Looking a little
            further ahead, trends for low-cost application-specific chips and novel low-power computing technologies
            will also enhance the practically-achievable processing ability for swarm nodes.</p>
          <h2>Motion control</h2>
          <p>Any swarm needs the ability to move in the domain in which it operates: the specifics of how that is
            achieved will of course depend on the domain. The air is perhaps the domain most closely associated with
            swarms, and here the significant market in commercial and retail drones is driving increased availability of
            low-cost flight control systems and motors. Other domains have fewer direct current commercial parallels,
            but the technologies needed to support node motion control are generally mature.</p>
          <h2>Power</h2>
          <p>As with any vehicle, swarm nodes need a power source. It needs to be cheap, of course, but also easily (and
            preferably autonomously) replenishable. Depending on which domain the swarm is to operate in, there will be
            other key requirements. In most cases, the power source will be the limiting factor on the length of mission
            the swarm can undertake: it's therefore particularly important to think carefully about whether sufficient
            performance can be achieved for an acceptable level of cost. In many cases, swarm nodes will be powered by
            batteries, and can therefore expect to benefit from trends for increasing battery energy density driven by
            consumer devices and electric vehicles.</p>
          <h2>Payload</h2>
          <p>Last, but by no means least, swarm nodes will need some sort of payload to deliver the functionality that
            is the reason for having the swarm in the first place. While there is a wide range of possibilities for what
            this might be, information-gathering is perhaps a prominent example. Here, nodes can benefit from the same
            trends that are set to increase the capability of the sensor suites available (described <a
              href="#navsense">above</a>) as well as trends supporting the development of more compact, less expensive
            sensors for small satellites, industrial automation, and the broad 'internet of things'.</p>
          <h2>Integration</h2>
          <p>After picking out the components and building your nodes, you still have to face the real technical
            challenge: making everything work together. That’s the final, critical piece of the puzzle – and while
            everything so far has been relatively straightforward, here we need to turn to the world of research and
            development.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="research" class="contentBody">
          <h1>The state of the art</h1>
          <p>In principle, and depending on the task, it shouldn’t be too difficult to get a swarm up and running. It is
            a complex task, requiring
            some in-depth system-of-systems thinking, but it seems like it ought to be doable. Unfortunately, while
            we’ve got quite good at designing control systems for things that work by themselves, those systems have a
            tendency to get unstable when you bundle them together in big groups – a problem compounded by the latency
            and error that are unavoidably present in real-world sensing and communication.<span class="reference">Liu,

          </p>
          <p>So while we’ve just about got the hang of building the algorithms that can make big swarms work in
            simulations, we’re only just starting to see those translated into real, physical swarms. Some of the
            headline-grabbing claims of huge swarms don’t really stack up if you look at the detail: they might have
            involved large numbers of nodes, but they often involve some degree of centralised remote control. Reports
            of swarm attacks on a Russian military base in Syria, for example, were based on the fact that the attackers
            used several small drones flying towards the target at the same time – but the drones weren’t collaborating
            or co-ordinating with each other.<span class="reference">Wright, Tim, ‘When is a Drone Swarm Not a Swarm?’,

            test in 2017 saw 103 of these small, low-cost drones being launched from F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft and
            autonomously carrying out a series of manoeuvres.<span class="reference">Mehta, Aaron, ‘Pentagon Launches

            </span> The drones
            themselves were designed using widely commercially-available components at MIT’s Lincoln Lab, carrying a
            small camera to capture images of targets. India’s more recent demonstration of a 75-strong swarm also seems
            broadly credible: this involved a group made up of several types of drone collaborating to identify and
            strike targets, although the degree to which the behaviour was pre-programmed is unclear, and the task was
            deliberately simple, using an uncluttered test area and stationary targets.<span class="reference">Hambling,

          <p>The US’s success with Perdix reflects its position as the world leader in carrying out swarming research.
            China also produces a large volume of research in the area – ranking second globally in the <i>count of
              scientific papers in the top 10% by citations</i> (a measure that attempts to combine both volume and
            quality). But the quality of China’s output is difficult to judge: the standard metrics for research impact
            place it behind the UK and the US, and it is significantly less internationally-connected, with just 25% of
            Chinese swarming research involving international collaborations, compared with 60% for the UK or 40% for
            the US.</p>

            Many of these commercial applications involve more controlled environments
            than a military context, with fewer complicating factors and less need for meaningful human control over
            actions: we may therefore see commercial swarms fielded before military swarms. This may present
            opportunities for militaries to learn from and drawn on civilian systems, as well as the potential for
            adversaries with fewer ethical constraints to employ these systems offensively.</p>

        <div id="bust" class="contentBody">
          <h1>Swarm-busting</h1>
          <p>The basic technology required to build a swarm is driven by the commercial world and is, or will be, easily
            commercially available. The greatest challenges facing a responsible user of swarms – ensuring that
            behaviours are robust to unexpected stimuli, maintaining meaningful human control over lethal force,
            integrating swarms into wider systems and concepts – may not be so important to every actor. It’s therefore
            reasonably likely that the UK will find swarms being used against us before we field a swarm of our own.
            Understanding how to tackle a hostile swarm is therefore important – and will be useful later to improve the
            resilience of any future UK swarm. There are two main categories of approach you could use: target the
            system – the swarm and its wider system of command and control – or target the nodes that make up the swarm.
          </p>
          <h2>Target the system</h2>
          <p>A swarm must be controllable to be useful. A hostile swarm may maintain some sort of communications link
            back to its operator: targeting that link could prevent further commands being issued to the swarm, forcing
            it to revert to autonomous operation based on pre-programmed objectives and its own, self-generated
            situational awareness. Tracing the communications link can also allow the adversary’s command and control
            architecture to be mapped, and can provide evidence to support identification of the operator of the swarm.
            If possible, spoofing the link may allow the swarm to be effectively hijacked. </p>
          <p>As described <a href="#what">at the start of this primer</a>, another way to control a swarm – besides
            sending it commands – is to control its environment. If you can present a swarm’s sensors with stimuli that
            you design, you can use its own control algorithm against it. This could mean spoofing a global navigation
            satellite system signal, blinding visible-light sensors with bright lights, or using flares to deceive
            infra-red cameras. The need to keep node costs low may make this an easier task than for other systems:
            low-cost sensors may lack built-in protections, leaving them vulnerable to manipulation. </p>
          <p>A swarm relies on information flows to be effective.<span class="reference">Aquilla, John and Ronfeldt,
              David, ‘Swarming & the future of conflict’, RAND
              Corporation, 2000, <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/documented_briefings/2005/RAND_DB311.pdf">https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/documented_briefings/2005/RAND_DB311.pdf</a></span>
            Without
            intra-swarm information flows, it is reduced from being a swarm to just being a group of un-co-ordinated
            nodes. As with sensors, the use of low-cost communications links within the swarm may leave these
            vulnerable. </p>
          <h2>Target the nodes</h2>
          <p>The easiest way to target the nodes that make up a swarm is to do so with something that affects all of
            them – or at least a large number of them – at the same time. The need to keep per-node costs down by using
            off-the-shelf components and the likely small size of nodes may mean they are easily destroyed or disrupted
            using explosive weapons with a large blast radius or electronic warfare capabilities that interfere with
            their control systems or propulsion. </p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, you do need to target nodes individually, you’ll need to use a weapon with a low
            cost per shot – and ideally one with minimal physical re-supply needs. Directed energy weapons are a good
            fit here, particularly for a situation in which power is in plentiful supply, like a fixed base or a large
            platform. Directed energy weapons also have the advantages of acting faster than a swarm’s reaction time,
            and of having (potentially) low cycle times, allowing many shots in a short period. But there are lower-tech
            alternatives, too: a water cannon might offer a useful defence against lightweight airborne swarm nodes, for
            example. </p>
          <p>Perhaps the ultimate counter-swarm approach would combine these two attributes: capacity to engage multiple
            nodes simultaneously, and at a low cost per shot. Distributed capability and low per-node cost are
            attributes of swarms – a counter-swarm swarm would make conceptual sense, and would have the potential to
            address other close-in threats as well. </p>

        </div>
        <div id="so" class="contentBody">
          <h1>So what?</h1>
          <p>Producing a practically useful swarm remains a challenging engineering problem, and many reports of
            swarming achievements are likely to overstate successes. Per-node cost is probably an equal or greater
            obstacle, compared with technology, to development of an operational swarm today. Growing availability of
            low-cost components and continued development effort mean that <strong>swarms may be mature enough to be
              applied in
              several commercial markets, as well as in a military context, within the next 5-10 years.</strong></p>
          <p>Many of the advantages swarms offer are a result of co-ordinated action by multiple nodes. These benefits
            can be realised with a system that falls short of the definition of a true swarm – for example using a large
            number of nodes controlled directly by a central hub. The additional autonomy of a true swarm will amplify
            the benefits, but the additional development effort required may not be worthwhile in all cases.</p>
          <p>Swarms have many potential applications in Defence, with information-gathering and transport offering less
            challenging control problems than offensive roles. Those control problems may not exist for adversaries, and
            we can expect the UK to be the target of a swarm attack before we field an offensive swarm of our own.
            Although defending against an attacking swarm seems a challenge, the inherent characteristics of a swarm can
            be used against it, tackling it at a system level by disrupting information flows within the swarm or by
            manipulating the swarm’s understanding of its environment to take control of it. The need to maintain low
            per-node costs is a weakness, as it may mean the de-prioritisation of protective features.
            Targeting these offers one way to affect multiple nodes at once, the most effective approach to eliminating
            a
            swarm. But if that isn’t possible, a counter-swarm weapon will need to have a low cost per shot, suggesting
            that directed energy weapons may be particularly well-suited to the role. A counter-swarm swarm may also be
            a good option, given that it combines low cost with capacity to engage multiple targets simultaneously.
